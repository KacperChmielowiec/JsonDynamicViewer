## üîç Log filtering
Log filtering is the most important feature in ULogViewer which helps you to find and analyze the problem from logs.
You can filter logs by:
- Text filter described by regular expression.
- Level(Priority) of log.
- Process ID of log if available.
- Thread ID of log if available.

For text filter, you can also predefine some filters you may use frequently and filter logs by cobination of these text filters.

## üìå Log marking
When viewing logs, you can mark some logs with different colors which are important for you. There is a separated side panel to list all marked logs to help you to jump to marked log quickly.
Marked logs will be kept if you are viewing logs from files so that you don't need to mark them again when you open log files next time.

## üìä Log Analysis (v2.0+)
Except for log filtering, you can also define rule sets or write scripts to analyze logs. Log analysis runs in background separately and generate results to a separated side panel. Currently there are 3 type of log analysis are supported:
- **Key Log Analysis**

  Find log with specific text pattern and level. You can extract information from log and put it to the result message.
- **Operation Duration Analysis**

  Find operation marked by specific starting and ending logs and calculate the duration of it. You can extract information from log and put it to the result message.
- **Log Analysis Script**

  Write script to analyze logs according to your requirement completely.
